This repository is for the computation of functional connectivities (covariance matrices) for patients in the HCP_1200 dataset. There are 1113 patients in the HCP_1200 dataset. A subset of them have at least one (of two possible) fmri scans for the REST1 portion of the dataset. Each available scan is parcelized according to an atlas (Deskian or Destreuix), activity values are averaged in these parcellizations for each time point thus creating a vector observation (each entry corresponds to a brain regions). These observations are then used to compute some functional connectivity matrix, either using all observations or windowed/sampled subsets.

If you would like to download these raw fmri/atlas files for yourself, see my other repo hcp-download-script here:
    https://github.com/maxwass/hcp-download-script

If you would like to read more about this data and how it was collected, see the review paper:
    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22366334/

Assumed directory structure:
    -It is assumed that all required fMRI/atlas files are in a directory named 'brain_data', and each patient has its own directory with the subject id as the directory name.
    -If directory path is changed, update the way the path2fmri variable is constructed appropriately in files _______
 
## Things to change for different machines **
1) utils/path_to_project()
    specify local path to project directory
2)
