This repository is for the computation of functional connectivities (covariance matrices) for patients in the HCP_1200 dataset. There are 1113 patients in the HCP_1200 dataset. A subset of them have at least one (of two possible) fmri scans for the REST1 portion of the dataset. Each available scan is parcelized according to an atlas (Deskian or Destreuix), activity values are averaged in these parcellizations for each time point thus creating a vector observation (each entry corresponds to a brain regions). These observations are then used to compute the overall covariance matrix.

If you would like to download these raw fmri/atlas files for yourself, see my other repo hcp-download-script here:

If you would like to read more about this data and how it was collected, see the review paper:

Project Layout:

fc_processing/ ==> compute to fcs from the data
    compute_fcs.m **
        Script coordinating fc computation for all patients. 
        Saves .mat for each patient with fc's and relavatn metadata
        Needs data files to run.
        Output of this script (for desikan atlas) can be found here: 
            https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LQocAEeEI02704KrmIior4HEcXx8KxSk?usp=sharing
    
    fmri_to_cov.m **
        Maps a single fmri scan (LR or RL) with its corresponding atlas raw to an fc.
        Needs raw data fmri/atlas files to run.
 
    load_fmri.m
        Takes raw fmri/atlas file, averages activity in atlas brain regions.
        Returns N x num_observations matrix - each column is a vector observation
    
    sc_fc_dataset.m **
        Create large tensors of fcs, scs, and metadata into a .mat file
    
    transform_sc.m
        Maps from raw scs to transformed scs via log(raw_edge+1)

data/  ==> .mat files outputted and/or used by other scripts
    brain_dataset_fc_sc_pairs.mat
        Output of sc_fc_dataset.m
        Pairs of scs and fcs (covariances and correlations of all scans available - lr and rl in REST1)
        Tensors are of shape 87x87x1064. To access one matrix use: fcs(:,:,idx_of_interest)
            If a scan is not available, the matrix will be all NaNs
        Associated metadata included (atlas used, subject ids, etc)
        Invariant: All data in same order. The fcs(:,:,i) <==> scs(:,:,i) <==> final_subject_list(i)
        *Not included in git download (too large 380 MB).*

            missing_LR = all patients in hcp_1200  w/o an LR scan for REST1
            missing_RL = all patients in hcp_1200 w/o an RL scan for REST1
            missing_LR_and_RL = patients in hcp_1200 missing LR & RL for REST1 (interesect of prev sets)
