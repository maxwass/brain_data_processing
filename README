%TODO: 
-ensure subject id's for structural graphs MATCH these subject id's

CHECK WITH ZHENGWU
    -correct cortical/subcortical indices used
    -covariance should be taken over all regions
    -how to combine LR/RL: convex combination ok?
    -REST2 useful? Any different than REST1? Can we use same structural graphs?


implimentation notes:

1)error when running correlation_calculation.,

“ft_getopt.mexmaci64” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

2) Atlas indices
-getting indices used for cortical/subcortical brain regions in atlas
%useful code:
% unique(subjlab.x100206_aparc_a2009s(~isnan(subjlab.x100206_aparc_a2009s)))
%  - run code, break point, open subjlab and subj_tdata and look
%  at fields. brain_strcture and brain_structure_label??
%  - use setdiff to find missing labels (corpus collosum)
