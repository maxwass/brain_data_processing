%TODO: 
-ensure subject id's for structural graphs MATCH these subject id's

CHECK WITH ZHENGWU
    -correct cortical/subcortical indices used
    -covariance should be taken over all time steps?
    -how to combine LR/RL: convex combination ok?
    -REST2 useful? Any different than REST1? Can we use same structural graphs?
    - does that atlas file (ex: 173233.aparc.32k_fs_LR.dlabel.nii) only need LR version? not RL version for RL dtseries file??
    -there are missing fcs from hcp_1200 database (scans without any LR or RL) (16 of them)
    -But there are also missing scs (48 of them)
    -16 of these do NOT have any corresponding scs BUT 32 of them have fcs. Are they simply missing sc scan?

implimentation notes:

1)error when running correlation_calculation.,

“ft_getopt.mexmaci64” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

2) Atlas indices
-talked with Marty to find indices for Desikan and Destrieux
    -to get indices used for cortical/subcortical brain regions in atlas
        > unique(subjlab.x100206_aparc_a2009s(~isnan(subjlab.x100206_aparc_a2009s)))
    -run code, break point, open subjlab and subj_tdata and look at fields. brain_strcture and brain_structure_label??
    -use setdiff to find missing labels (corpus collosum)
-to confirm check file prrovided by Yang (load_brain_data_FC_SC.m)
    -load file
    -check variable: ChosenROI_cortical and ChosenROI_subcortical
